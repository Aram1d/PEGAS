## How to submit an issue

PEGAS is a quite complex piece of software, and due to notorious difficulty in debugging anything in kOS (one has to run the entire ascent) it is not free from bugs or errors.
I am willing to provide support and correct those bugs.
The best way to notify me about problems and receive help is via the [issues tracker](../../../issues).
Private messages on [forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com) also work.

1. Check the issue tracker - maybe I already know about the problem?
2. Check the [tutorial](tutorial.md) and [reference](reference.md) - maybe the answer is there already?
3. If not, describe what's wrong.
If you get an error message - what does it say?
If PEGAS crashes - when and how?
If PEGAS fails to get to orbit - provide as much info as you can: `vehicle`, `controls`, `sequence` and `mission` contents, `.craft` file - anything that would allow me to reproduce your issue.
4. If the problem requires attaching a `.craft` file, please try to strip it of as many mods as possible. I do run a RO install with plenty of them installed, among others:  
ASET Avionics  
Cryogenic Engines  
Cryogenic Tanks  
DMagic Orbital Science  
Kerbal Attachment System  
Procedural Fairings  
Procedural Parts  
Real Scale Boosters  
SCANsat  
Soviet Engine Pack  
TAC Life Support  
US Probes Pack  
I *could* install some other thing, but the easier you make it for me to help you, the faster and more reliably I can do that.

I welcome all usage questions and improvement suggestions, even to the documentation.
If something is unclear, or badly explained - please let me know.
